## üéØ Project Overview

This project develops an innovative pipeline that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract metadata from computational neuroscience model **source code**. The system aims to enhance model discoverability and reusability in neuroscience research by automating the metadata annotation process.

### Key Features
- Automated metadata extraction using state-of-the-art LLMs
- Intelligent file screening and preprocessing pipeline
- High-quality classification for neuroscience model codes
- Comprehensive evaluation framework

## Tech Stack

- **Core Technologies**:
  - Python 3.8+
  - OpenAI GPT API
  - Azure Authentication
  - ModelDB API

- **Key Libraries**: Requirements are specified in `requirements.yml`

## Results & Impact

Our LLM-based approach has demonstrated significant improvements over traditional rule-based methods:

- Successfully automated metadata extraction from complex neuroscience model code
- Achieved higher precision and recall in identifying model applications compared to rule-based approaches
- Reduced manual effort in metadata assignment
- Enhanced accessibility of neuroscience models for researchers
