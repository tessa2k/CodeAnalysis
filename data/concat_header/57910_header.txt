Chiesa N, Rosati B, Arcangeli A, Olivotto M, Wanke E. A novel role 
for HERG K+ channels: spike-frequency adaptation. J Physiol 1997;501:313-318

Abstract:
1. The regular firing of a Hodgkin-Huxley neurone endowed with fast Na+ 
and delayed K+ channels can be converted into adapting firing by appending 
HERG (human eag-related gene) channels. 2. The computer model predictions 
were verified by studying the firing properties of F-11 DRG neurone x 
neuroblastoma hybrid cells induced to differentiate by long- term exposure 
to retinoic acid. These cells, which express HERG currents (IHERG), show 
clear spike-frequency adaptation of their firing when current clamped with 
long depolarizations. 3. In agreement with the prediction, the selective 
blocking of IHERG by class III antiarrhythmic drugs always led to the 
disappearance of the spike- frequency adaptation, and the conversion of 
adapting firing to regular firing. 4. It is proposed that, in addition to their 
role in the repolarization of the heart action potential, HERG channels may 
sustain a process of spike-frequency adaptation, and hence contribute to the 
control of burst duration in a way that is similar to that of the K+ currents,
