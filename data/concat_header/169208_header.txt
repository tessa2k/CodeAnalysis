script

%   This script formats the 2 parameter velocity data into two
%   vectors with par1 and par2 values and a matrix with (i, j)th
%   element being the conduction velocity resulting from the ith
%   par1 value and jth par2 value.  Use this script only once.
%   Use velsetupnext.m for additional data for the same plot.
%   To use, first load the vel(par1, par2) data from a dat file
%   into the matrix 'data' with the following command:
%   data = load('location/filename.dat').  Next, use the command:
%   velsetupfirst

%   E.g.
%   data = load('VELOCITY-141106_myeL_gap_1.dat');
%   velsetupfirst
%   data = load('VELOCITY-141106_myeL_gap_2.dat');
%   velsetupnext

numofrows = size(data, 1);

script

%   Run this to include additional 2 parameter velocity data.
%   Thus, the data generated from velsetupfirst.m is updated.
%   Run after velsetupfirst.m and follow the same instructions,
%   except use command: velsetupnext instead.
%   velsetupfirst.m should only be used once, but velsetupnext.m
%   can be used as many times as needed after velsetupfirst.m
%   has been used.

%   E.g.
%   data = load('VELOCITY-141106_myeL_gap_1.dat');
%   velsetupfirst
%   data = load('VELOCITY-141106_myeL_gap_1.dat');
%   velsetupnext

numofdata = size(data, 1);

for i = 1:numofdata
    newpar1 = data(i, 1);

After the data from NEURON is generated, these .m files can be used with MATLAB to 
open and sort these files into more useful vectors and matrices.  It is recommended 
that the generated .dat files be in the same directory or in a subdirectory as the 
.m files.  Instructions for their use are in comments in their respective codes.

velsetupfirst.m and velsetupnext.m are used to sort the 2-parameter velocity data.
voltsetup.m is used to sort the voltage data.

=== Following is the header of samples/169208/YoungEtAl2013/MATLAB files/voltsetup.m ===
function [pos, time, volt] = voltsetup(filename)

%   This script formats the voltage data from filename.dat (string)
%   Outputs are:
%   pos = n x 1 vector containing the positions, where first position is
%   defined to be at 0
%   time = m x 1 vector containing the times, where the first time is
%   defined to be at 0
%   volt = m x n matrix where volt(i, j) is the voltage of position n at
%   time m

%   E.g.
%   [posI1, timeI1, voltI1] = voltsetup('INTVOLTAGE-150108_gap_1.dat');
%   [posI2, timeI2, voltI2] = voltsetup('INTVOLTAGE-150108_gap_2.dat');
%   [posE1, timeE1, voltE1] = voltsetup('EXTVOLTAGE-150108_gap_1.dat');
%   [posE2, timeE2, voltE2] = voltsetup('EXTVOLTAGE-150108_gap_2.dat');

 data = load(filename);
 pos = data(1, 2:end);
 pos = pos';

This is a readme for the model and data analysis files for the paper:

Young RG, Castelfranco AM, Hartline DK (2013) The "Lillie transition":
models of the onset of saltatory conduction in myelinating axons. J
Comput Neurosci 34:533-46

Please see the readme's in the NEURON and MATLAB folders.  You will
need to run NEURON first, then MATLAB.

-----VOLTAGE-----

Attached are five files related to obtaining voltages.  With these, you should be 
able to load our base neuron, change most of its parameters (e.g. tighten delta, 
the submyelin gap size), and record the voltages of a certain region of the neuron. 
 The files with INTVOLTAGE in their names record trans-axolemmal voltages, while 
the files with EXTVOLTAGE in their names record trans-fiber voltages.

Base neuron:
 NEURON_001-130308.hoc
Algorithms:
 ALG_PARCHA-130523.hoc ("PARameter CHAnge")

BATCH_INTVOLTAGE-150108_gap.hoc and BATCH_EXTVOLTAGE-150108_gap.hoc are the only 
HOC file that should be executed.  Both will load the base neuron and the parameter
