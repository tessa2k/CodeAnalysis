The following simulations work well in NEURON 6.2.  They do NOT work
well in NEURON 5.6 and NEURON 5.8.  Other versions of NEURON have not
been tested.

T-type Ca channel 
ca.mod to lead to thalamic ca current inspired by destexhe and huguenrd
Uses fixed eca instead of GHK eqn
changed from (AS Oct0899)
changed for use with Ri18  (B.Kampa 2005)

added DERIVATIVE block for use with cvode (C.Acker 2008)

TITLE decay of internal calcium concentration
:
: Internal calcium concentration calculated from calcium currents 
: and buffered by endogenous buffer and extrusion mechanism.
:
: Uses differential equations from Helmchen 1996
:dCa/dt = (dCa_T delta_t - (gamma*(dCa - Ca_rest)))/kb
: or dCa/dt = (dCa_T delta_t)/kb - (dCa - Ca_rest)/taur 
: with  taur = kb/gamma
:
: to add exogenous buffer kb = 1+kendo+kexo
: for OGB-1 kexo = concOGB1/kd = 200uM/0.2uM => kb=1020
: for OGB-6 kexo = concOGB6/kd = 200uM/3uM   => kb=80
:
: mod file was modified from original version (Destexhe 92)
: use diam/4 instead of depth to calculate [Ca]
: Units checked using "modlunit" -> factor 10000 needed in ca entry

=== Following is the header of samples/117207/acker_antic/Model/na.mod ===

COMMENT
26 Ago 2002 Modification of original channel to allow variable time step and to correct an initialization error.
    Done by Michael Hines(michael.hines@yale.e) and Ruggero Scorcioni(rscorcio@gmu.edu) at EU Advance Course in Computational Neuroscience. Obidos, Portugal


na.mod

Sodium channel, Hodgkin-Huxley style kinetics.  

Kinetics were fit to data from Huguenard et al. (1988) and Hamill et
al. (1991)

qi is not well constrained by the data, since there are no points
between -80 and -55.  So this was fixed at 5 while the thi1,thi2,Rg,Rd
were optimized using a simplex least square proc

voltage dependencies are shifted approximately from the best
fit to give higher threshold
