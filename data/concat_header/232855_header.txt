This is the readme for the model associated with
Stinchcombe, AR et al., 'Multiplexing Visual Signals in the Suprachiasmatic Nuclei', Cell Reports, Volume 21, Issue 6, 1418-1425.

To run, enter "SCNephyssimulation" at the MATLAB command prompt. A raster plot will be generated showing the spike times of SCN neurons for a full field flash stimulus and a randomly generated connectivity. This code was developed in MATLAB R2017a.
