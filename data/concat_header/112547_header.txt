Ref: Laventovich and Hemkin, A mathematical model of spontaneous
calcium(II) oscillations in astrocytes.  J Theor Biol 2008;
251(4):553-60.

Abstract:

Astrocytes exhibit oscillations and waves of Ca2+ ions within their
cytosol and it appears that this behavior helps facilitate the
astrocyte's interaction with its environment, including its
neighboring neurons. Often changes in the oscillatory behavior are
initiated by an external stimulus such as glutamate, recently however,
it has been observed that oscillations are also initiated
spontaneously. We propose here a mathematical model of how spontaneous
Ca2+ oscillations arise in astrocytes. This model uses the
calcium-induced calcium release and inositol cross-coupling mechanisms
coupled with a receptor-independent method for producing inositol
(1,4,5)-trisphosphate as the heart of the model. By computationally
