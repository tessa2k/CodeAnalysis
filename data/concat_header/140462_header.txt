TITLE Sustained calcium current from plateau potential-firing rat olfactory glomerular neurons

: originally implemented by Maciej Lazarewicz 2003 (mlazarew@seas.upenn.edu)
: original title - Calcium high-threshold L type current for RD Traub, J Neurophysiol 89:909-921, 2003
: Modified by Arjun Masurkar to resemble HVA current in plateau-firing
: juxtaglomerular neurons

: changes: carev=35
: to change: IV curve should match (peak I at 0mv, activation similar to IT)

COMMENT

na.mod

Sodium channel, Hodgkin-Huxley style kinetics.  


qi is not well constrained by the data, since there are no points
between -80 and -55.  So this was fixed at 5 while the thi1,thi2,Rg,Rd
were optimized using a simplex least square proc

voltage dependencies are shifted approximately +5mV from the best
fit to give higher threshold
