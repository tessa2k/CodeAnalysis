# This XPPAUT file contains the program for the activity of a 
# pituitary lactotroph as described in the paper "A Geometric Understanding of how
# Fast Activating Potassium Channels Promote Bursting in Pituitary Cells", T. Vo, J. Tabak,
# R. Bertram, M. Wechselberger, J. Comput. Neurosci., 36:259-278, 2014.

# Variables:
#    v -- membrane potential
#    b -- BK current activation
#    n -- delayed rectifier K current activation
#    c -- calcium concentration

# Initial conditions
v(0)=-56
b(0)=0
n(0)=0 
c(0)=0.27

# Maximal conductances

Note from the ModelDB administrator: to run with XPP version 7.0 I
found I needed to change bell=off to bell=0 on one of the last few
lines.

The model when run in its default setting:
