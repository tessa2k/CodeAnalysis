COMMENT

na.mod

Sodium channel, Hodgkin-Huxley style kinetics.  

Kinetics were fit to data from Huguenard et al. (1988) and Hamill et
al. (1991)

qi is not well constrained by the data, since there are no points
between -80 and -55.  So this was fixed at 5 while the thi1,thi2,Rg,Rd
were optimized using a simplex least square proc

voltage dependencies are shifted approximately from the best
fit to give higher threshold

COMMENT

Measures peak depol and calculates spike half width from the times at
which v crosses a (depolarized) threshold.  Threshold may be specified
by the user, or determined in the previous run.

Ted Carnevale

20110616 Modified by Tom Morse to follow the prescriptions of Amanda
Casale's matlab code threshdetect_neuronmod.m The notation was changed
to match the matlab variable names.  Also used method from Arnd Roth's
peak.mod from modeldb accession #135838 for dvdt.

20110522 Modified by Tom Morse to add measurements of 10-90% rise and
fall times as suggested by Amanda Casale.  Also the minimum voltage
used for calculations was changed from the initialization voltage to
an actual minimum (if run in mode 1,2)

USAGE EXAMPLES

//////////////////////////
// User-specified threshold
forall insert mhw
forall for (x,0) Halfheight_mhw(x) = THRESH // must assign value everywhere
mode_mhw = 0 // determine half width from fixed threshold
run()
printf(" base \t peak \t Halfheight \thalf width\n")
printf("%6.2f \t%6.2f \t%6.2f \t%6.2f\n", \
       Vthresh_mhw(0.5), Peak_mhw(0.5), Halfheight_mhw(0.5), Width_mhw(0.5))
//////////////////////////

//////////////////////////
// Dynamically-determined threshold
// run two simulations, first time with parameter mode_mhw = 1
//   and second time with mode_mhw = 2
// At end of first run, tmax and Peak will equal time and value of peak depol, and
// Vthresh will be set to the v where the membrane v's derivative dvdt exceeded
//    slope_thresh, a parameter set by the user prior to calling.
// At end of second run, Halfheight will be threshold for measurement of spike half width,
//    Risetime and Falltime will be the 90% rise time and fall time respectively,

TITLE kht.mod  The high threshold conductance of cochlear nucleus neurons

COMMENT

NEURON implementation of Jason Rothman's measurements of VCN conductances.

This file implements the high threshold potassium current found in several brainstem
 nuclei of the auditory system, including the spherical and globular bushy cells
  (Manis and Marx, 1991; Rothman and Manis, 2003a,b) and multipolar (stellate) 
  cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus, principal cells of the medial 
  nucleus of the trapzoid body (Brew and Forsythe, 1995, Wang and Kaczmarek, 
  1997) and neurons of the medial superior olive. The current is likely mediated by 
  Kv3.1  potassium channel subunits. The specific 
  implementation is described in Rothman and Manis, J. Neurophysiol. 2003, in the 
  appendix. Measurements were made from isolated neurons from adult guinea pig, 
  under reasonably stringent voltage clamp conditions. The measured current is 
  sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and TEA, but is spared by mamba snake toxi
  dendrotoxin I.


Similar conductrances are found in the homologous neurons of the avian auditory 
system (Reyes and Rubel; Zhang and Trussell; Rathouz and Trussell), and the 
conductance described here, in the absence of more detailed kinetic measurements
, is probably suitable for use in modeling that system.


Original implementation by Paul B. Manis, April (JHU) and Sept, (UNC)1999.

This is the readme for the model associated with the paper

Casale AE, McCormick DA (2011) Active action potential propagation but
not initiation in thalamic interneuron dendrites.
J Neurosci 31:18289-302

These files were contributed by Amanda Casale.

General description of the model:

This model explores conductance distributions in dendrites for
comparison to voltage-sensitive dye optical recordings from
thalamic interneuron dendrites in the dorsal lateral geniculate
nucleus.
The purpose is to assess action potential kinetics and amplitude in
thalamic interneuron dendrite models under different dendritic
conductance distributions.

Example Use:

The auto-launch (mosinit.hoc) will start the simulation with the
configuration that most closely matched experiment. Compile the mod
files first with mknrndll (MAC and mswin) or nrnivmodl (linux/unix) if
starting manually. Click the measure button to run the simulation and
generate graphs of kinetics.  A graph similar to that in Figure 10E's
50-25% red line is among those displayed:

comparison against the real cell.
Active Axon = 50 to 25% condition
Full Grad = 100 to 0% condition
No Na Dend = 0% sodium condition (our passive condition)
