glutamate.mod This is the simulated glutamate impact on the
postsynaptic cell via AMPA/NMDA receptors

Release parameters include 

del: delay for the first pulse
Tspike: interspike (presynaptic release) intervals
Nspike: number of presynaptic pulses
gNMDAmax and gAMPAmax: postsynaptic conductances, in case of NMDA, the
peak possible conductance. In this simulation AMPA conductance was set
to zero.
